## Preview

This repository contains the official CULTURECODE agency website — a modern SaaS-style marketing site built to showcase our work, services, and approach. The design draws inspiration from best-in-class product companies: minimal, fast, and focused on clarity. It serves as both our public presence and a reference implementation for the kind of work we deliver.

**Purpose:** A production-ready agency website that demonstrates our standards for typography, layout, motion, and component architecture. No templates. No shortcuts.

## Philosophy

CULTURECODE is built on three principles:

**Clean code** — Readable, maintainable, and well-structured. Every component has a clear responsibility.

**Modern design** — Typography, spacing, and motion that feel deliberate. No clutter, no noise.

**Premium quality** — Output that could ship to enterprise clients. We don’t cut corners.
